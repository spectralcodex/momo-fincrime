## Mobile wallet Fraud detection using PaySim


###  About Dataset

#### Context

PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.

This synthetic dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset and it is created just for Kaggle.

NOTE: Transactions which are detected as fraud are cancelled, so for fraud detection these columns (oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest ) must not be used.

#### Headers

This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation:

1,PAYMENT,1060.31,C429214117,1089.0,28.69,M1591654462,0.0,0.0,0,0


The dataset contains the following attributes:

* **step:** This is a unit of time representing one hour in the real world. The total number of steps is 744, corresponding to a 30-day simulation.

* **type:** The type of transaction performed. The possible types are *CASH-IN*, *CASH-OUT*, *DEBIT*, *PAYMENT*, and *TRANSFER*.

#### About type of transactions
* CASH-IN: Refers to depositing cash into an account (adding funds).

* CASH-OUT: Refers to withdrawing cash from an account (removing funds).

* DEBIT: It refer to a decrease in the balance of a financial account due to a withdrawal or an expense.

* PAYMENT: Refers to the transfer of money from one party (payer) to another (payee) in exchange for goods, services, or as settlement of a debt.

* TRANSFER: Refers to moving money from one account to another, often between accounts held by the same person or entity.


* **amount:** The transaction amount in your preferred local currency (Â£ in my case).

* **nameOrig:** The customer who initiated the transaction.

* **oldBalanceOrig:** The initial balance of the customer before the transaction.

* **newBalanceOrig:** The new balance of the customer after the transaction.

* **nameDest:** The recipient of the transaction.

* **oldBalanceDest:** The initial balance of the recipient before the transaction. There is no information for customers whose names start with "M" (merchants).

* **newBalanceDest:** The new balance of the recipient after the transaction. As with "oldbalanceDest," there is no information for customers whose names start with "M." (merchants)

* **isFraud:** Indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent.

* **isFlaggedFraud:** Flags transactions that exceed a certain threshold. In this dataset, transfers over 200,000 in a single transaction are flagged as potentially fraudulent.
