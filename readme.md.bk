### Context
Mobile money fraud detection using machine learning is critical in safeguarding financial ecosystems. It involves applying advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to identify suspicious activities and prevent real-time fraudulent transactions. An effective fraud detection system should be able to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and efficiency. While avoiding bad actors from executing fraudulent transactions is necessary, ensuring genuine users can access the payment system is also critical. However, many false positives may lead to a poor customer experience, potentially driving customers to take their business elsewhere and highlighting the need for accurate fraud detection.

### Other Challenges 
 A significant challenge in building fraud detection models in research is the availability of transactional datasets due to confidentiality and data governance policies around financial data. Another major challenge in applying Machine Learning to fraud detection is the presence of highly imbalanced data sets. In many available datasets, most transactions are genuine, with a tiny percentage of fraudulent transactions. Designing an accurate and efficient fraud detection system that is low on false positives but detects fraudulent activity effectively is a significant challenge for researchers. 
 
### About Dataset 
The lack of legitimate datasets in mobile money transactions to perform fraud detection research has always been a big problem. This will leave researchers with the burden of harnessing the datasets before conducting the research. Paysim is a financial simulator that simulates mobile money transactions based on an original dataset.

PaySim is based on a sample of genuine mobile money transactions from an African country provided by a multinational company with services in over 14 countries. This synthetic approach offers a valuable resource for advancing fraud detection research. Clone PaySim source repository at https://github.com/EdgarLopezPhD/PaySim/tree/master which is a java based application.

*These fields form the basis of the synthetic dataset, providing a comprehensive view of transaction activities while offering opportunities to study and test fraud detection methods.*


### Research Goals
1. Are there limitations in using ensemble learning to combat modern-day Mobile Money fraud?
2. Can these limitations be fixed or improved?
3. Is ensemble learning an effective combatant against mobile money fraud in contrast to traditional solutions like data mining, anonymous tip lines (including online or website) and financial auditing?



###  About Dataset

PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.

This synthetic dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset and it is created just for Kaggle.

NOTE: Transactions which are detected as fraud are cancelled, so for fraud detection these columns (oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest ) must not be used.

#### Headers

This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation:

1,PAYMENT,1060.31,C429214117,1089.0,28.69,M1591654462,0.0,0.0,0,0


The dataset contains the following attributes:

* **step:** This is a unit of time representing one hour in the real world. The total number of steps is 744, corresponding to a 30-day simulation.

* **type:** The type of transaction performed. The possible types are *CASH-IN*, *CASH-OUT*, *DEBIT*, *PAYMENT*, and *TRANSFER*.

#### About type of transactions
* CASH-IN: Refers to depositing cash into an account (adding funds).

* CASH-OUT: Refers to withdrawing cash from an account (removing funds).

* DEBIT: It refer to a decrease in the balance of a financial account due to a withdrawal or an expense.

* PAYMENT: Refers to the transfer of money from one party (payer) to another (payee) in exchange for goods, services, or as settlement of a debt.

* TRANSFER: Refers to moving money from one account to another, often between accounts held by the same person or entity.


* **amount:** The transaction amount in your preferred local currency (Â£ in my case).

* **nameOrig:** The customer who initiated the transaction.

* **oldBalanceOrig:** The initial balance of the customer before the transaction.

* **newBalanceOrig:** The new balance of the customer after the transaction.

* **nameDest:** The recipient of the transaction.

* **oldBalanceDest:** The initial balance of the recipient before the transaction. There is no information for customers whose names start with "M" (merchants).

* **newBalanceDest:** The new balance of the recipient after the transaction. As with "oldbalanceDest," there is no information for customers whose names start with "M." (merchants)

* **isFraud:** Indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent.

* **isFlaggedFraud:** Flags transactions that exceed a certain threshold. In this dataset, transfers over 200,000 in a single transaction are flagged as potentially fraudulent.
